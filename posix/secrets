# version 4
# -------------------------------

# # This file must be readable and writable by the owner only (mode 0600).

# This file contains username and password for the proxy, the
# WebDAV resources and decryption passwords for client certificates.

# Comments are indicated by a '#' character and the rest of the line
# is ignored. Empty lines are ignored too.

# Each line consists of two or three items separated by spaces or tabs.
# If an item contains one of the characters space, tab, #, \ or ", this
# character must be escaped by a preceding \. Alternatively, the item
# may be enclosed in double quotes.


# Proxy Line
# ----------
# A proxy line consists of the fully qualified domain name of the proxy,
# the username and the password. The proxy name must not contain a scheme
# or path segment, but a port number should be added, separated by a colon.
# The password my be omitted.
# Instead of the name of the proxy, the keyword "proxy" may be used.

# Examples
# foo.bar:3245                  otto          my\ secret
# foo.bar                       otto          "my secret"
# proxy                         otto          "my secret"


# Credential Line
# ---------------
# A credential line consists of the mountpoint, the username and
# the password. The mountpoint must be an absolute path, starting
# with /. The password may be omitted.
# For compatibility with older versions, instead of the mountpoint
# the url may be given. The url must contain scheme, fully qualified
# domain name and path. If the path segment is missing, / is assumed.

# Examples
# /home/otto/foo                otto          g3H\"x\ 7z\\
# /media/dav/bar                otto          geheim
# Old style
# "http://foo.bar/my documents" otto          "geh # heim"
# https://foo.bar:333/dav       otto          geh\ \#\ heim

# Password for Client Certificate
# -------------------------------
# It must contain the name of the certificate file and the encryption
# password. The name must be either absolute (starting with /) or the
# filename only. If it is not absolute, it is assumed to be in the
# standard directory for client certificates.

# Examples
# /home/otto/.davfs2/certs/private/otto.crt  geheim
# otto_private.crt              "this is extraordinary secret"
# "otto private.crt"            this\ is\ secret,\ too.
